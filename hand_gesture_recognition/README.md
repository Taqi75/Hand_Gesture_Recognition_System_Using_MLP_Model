USER DOCUMENTATION MANUAL

This is a project which shows the working of a MLP Model on a Hand Gesture Recognition System with other Models.
This project uses MediaPipe, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to recognize hand gestures in real-time from a webcam feed.
You can go through the powerpoint presentation and that should help you understand the gist of it.

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
a) Python 3.7 or later
b) OpenCV
c) NumPy
d) MediaPipe
e) TensorFlow/Keras

To run the Project:

i)You can download the folder and upload it on a suitable platform like visual studios or jupyter notebook to get it working
(Make sure that the other files are also present along with the hand_gesture_recognition.py file when you run it.)

ii)Open the terminal for the python file, and execute this line: "python hand_gesture_recognition.py" in the termianl.
iii)That should run the code and you should be able to experience how the MLP model works.
iv)In order to quit, just press q.
